          "quote": "We Could Stay, the Brooklyn electronic musician’s staggering debut, artfully oscillates between moments of hypnotic bliss and jarring violence...each track is a full journey, Wagner gleefully bending dance music tropes into unpredictable shapes. Inspect his wall of sound a little closer, and you’ll discover the thunderous roar cleverly hiding a pop sensibility...We Could Stay is breathlessly thrilling—bruised, beautiful, and completely engulfing.",

There’s a seductive elegance to the track’s destruction, like spending your final moments caught in a tornado, marveling at its power. In its last quarter, the noisy layers of 'Release Yrself' fall away, leaving the softly glowing embers of a lullaby-like melody. Right when it feels light enough to drift off on the breeze, Wagner brings in a startling, stabbing trance synth, caking it with the blistering overdrive of a tape deck eating itself.",

Yet, take an extended dive into her new record, and one discovers a creative, downright exciting intensity bursting from all the songs on Songies... This mature, intelligently constructed indie pop has some of 2023’s finest moments...Give this wonderful, catchy record a listen, and we promise at least three sequences that will immediately whet your ears for more.",

It is safe to expect her to continue gaining traction through her originality and vocal ability, uplifting listeners during darker times.",
